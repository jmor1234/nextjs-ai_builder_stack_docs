# Agentic LLM Assistant for Software Development: Completed Process and Components

## Project Goal
To create an LLM-powered agentic application that assists in building full-stack responsive web applications using a specific software stack.

## Tech Stack
- Next.js
- Clerk Auth (integrated with Convex)
- Convex Dev (backend as a service)
- Pinecone Vector Database
- ShadCN/UI Component Library
- Vercel AI SDK

## Challenge
LLMs lack up-to-date and clean RAG access to the documentation for these libraries, and the documentation providers don't offer single, clean markdown files containing all their documentation.

## Completed Solution Components

1. Manual Documentation Retrieval (Completed):
   - Manually collected documentation for each library
   - Translated plain text into clean, well-structured markdown
   - Created separate markdown files for each library (except Clerk, which is integrated into Convex)

2. Master Agent Concept (Developed):
   - Designed to orchestrate the use of different libraries based on task requirements
   - Conceived to have a high-level understanding of each library without full documentation

3. Knowledge Base Creation (Completed):
   a. Comprehensive Essays:
      - Created detailed overviews of each library
      - Covered core concepts, key features, and unique aspects
      - Provided context and use cases for each library

   b. Concise Use Cases and Selection Guide:
      - Developed brief, clear summaries of each library's primary role
      - Outlined key decision-making factors
      - Provided a framework for library selection

4. Master Agent Decision-Making Process (Designed):
   - Utilizes both comprehensive essays and concise guides
   - Aims to quickly assess which library or combination of libraries is most appropriate for a given task

5. Modular and Agentic Approach (Conceptualized):
   - Master agent designed to orchestrate more specialized sub-agents
   - Addresses context limitation issues of LLMs
   - Allows for focused, efficient use of documentation

This approach creates a sophisticated, modular system that can effectively assist in software development using the specified tech stack, overcoming the limitations of current LLMs in accessing and utilizing up-to-date library documentation. The foundation of the system, including documentation retrieval, knowledge base creation, and the conceptual framework for the master agent, has been completed and is ready for implementation and further development.
